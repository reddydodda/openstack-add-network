# Introduction
This script was implemented for the easy adding a new external network to the cloud.

Assumed that this script will be installed and run on the FUEL master node.

The full instruction you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoZhuKqsdS-UZ7WtJOZBsITyGvIytAXTlmED0sqcpLM/edit#)

# Warning
Please be aware that this script was tested only for MOS 7.0.

I guees it should work for other MOS versions, but I haven't tested it. I will do it when I will have a chance.

# Health check

Before starting you should make sure that everything works pretty good:
```
pcs status
rabbitmqctl cluster_status
mysql -e "show status"
neutron agent-list
nova service-list
```

# Install
First of all you need to clone this repo to the fuel master node:
```
git clone https://github.com/aepifanov/openstack-add-network.git
```

# One short adding
The the easiest way to add a new external network is the execute the following script:
```
./add_ext_net.sh <NAME> <IF> <MTU> <CIDR> <GATEWAY>  <START_FIP_RANGE> <END_FIP_RANGE> [DVR]
```
This script just performs all the following steps automatically.

# Step by step adding
If you have some network modification or want to do it with additional checking you can
perform the following steps manually:

1. Prepare the cloud for working with multiple external network
   (if you don't use DVR you shoud use only controller for search template in awk):
    ```
    for i in $(fuel node  | awk '/controller|compute/ {print $10}'); do ssh $i 'bash -x -s' < ./1.prepare_for_multi_ext_net.sh; done
    ```

    1.1. If you want to make sure that everything work after this change you just need to
         restart neutron services and test it:
         ```
         ./restart_netutron_services DVR
         ```

2. Create network infrastructure for new external network:
   (if you don't use DVR you shoud use only controller for search template in awk):
   ```
   for i in $(fuel node  | awk '/controller|compute/ {print $10}'); do ssh $i 'bash -x -s' < ./2.create_infra_for_new_ext_net.sh <NAME> <IF> <MTU> ; done
   ```

3. Restart all neutron services on all nodes
    ```
    ./restart_netutron_services DVR
    ```

4. Create a new external network:
    ```
    HOST=$(fuel node | awk '/controller/ { print $10 }' | head -n 1) && ssh $HOST 'bash -x -s' < ./3.create_new_ext_net.sh <NAME> <CIDR> <GATEWAY> <START_FIP_RANGE> <END_FIP_RANGE>
    ```

If you need to add N ext networks you should repeat N times steps **2** and **4**.

Enjoy!
